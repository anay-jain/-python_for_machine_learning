from sklearn.linear_model import SVC as model
clf = model()



// .fit (for traing a classifier)
// .predict (to have an ouput for an input )

skfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, random_state=42)
kflod validation . just divide it into n chunks and remove 1 chunk for  a validation .. doing ut for all


y_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3)
cv = no of kfolds for validation

confusion_matrix(y_train_5, y_train_pred)
only accuracy feautre will be a problem
as 1 in 100000 in binary classfication is 0
so it will give 1 everytime and have the high accuracy 
then confusion_matrix comes into pic
